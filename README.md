# canonical_elk

Just a simple set of 3 microservices: Elasticsearch, Logstash & Kibana.

You need `docker` and `docker-compose` to run this set.

Run `./restart` to start everything. Then you will be able to access Kibana
interface at http://docker/ and there will be one sample event.

Run `./stop` to stop and remove microservices.
